Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I created this page to view the current weather and 5 day forecast based on locations that you enter while using the OpenWeather API. This page will save previous searched data for ease of use when jumping between previous searched cities. The current weather and forecast will display the date, current searched city, the temperature (in degrees), the wind speed (in MPH) and the humidity as well as a brief description of the weather and a matching icon.
